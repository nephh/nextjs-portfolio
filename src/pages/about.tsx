        Hello! My name is Owen McCormick, I am a junior developer, and I love to
        create. I am motivated by my love for computers and a desire to leverage
        technology to create a vast amount of interesting ideas. <br />
        <br />I have always been partial to computers, and in 2022 I decided I
        wanted to pursue becoming a programmer as a full-time job. Prior to
        this, programming had been a small hobby of mine. I begin in C++,
        learning to mod and manipulate video games, and then moved towards
        Python in order to create a small Twitter Bot. <br />
        <br />
        Since then, I decided to take a bootcamp on web development and really
        push towards making this a career. My biggest strength is my desire to
        learn. I have no problem picking up a brand new language, framework, or
        software and learning the ins and outs of it in order to accomplish my
        goals. <br />
        <br />I am incredibly excited to build interesting projects, and
        continue to learn the ins and outs of being a developer.
